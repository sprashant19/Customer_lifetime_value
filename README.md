# Customer_lifetime_value

**Problem Statement**


VahanBima is one of the leading insurance companies in India. It provides motor vehicle insurance at the best prices with 24/7 claim settlement. It offers different types of policies for both personal and commercial vehicles. It has established its brand across different regions in India.

Around 90% of businesses today use personalized services. The company wants to launch different personalized experience programs for customers of VahanBima. The personalized experience can be dedicated resources for claim settlement, different kinds of services at the doorstep, etc. In order to do so, they would like to segment the customers into different tiers based on their customer lifetime value (CLTV).

In order to do it, they would like to predict the customer lifetime value based on the activity and interaction of the customer with the platform. So, as a part of this challenge, the task at hand is to build a high-performance and interpretable machine learning model to predict the CLTV based on user and policy data.
